# Trevor's Website

Hello!

This is the home of my personal website. 

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal site, structured in TTL.

Example:
```yaml
section [
   title: formatted: code {print("Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹")}}
   body {
      I'm a multi-line string.
   }
]
```

## Project Structure

1. I manually create the `.ttl` files for each page on the website (along with the corresponding `/templates`. 
2. On GH push, a GH action executes the TTL.py on all the `.ttl` files in the root directiory to generate the HTML.
3. When the HTML is commited to the production branch (by the GH action), my webserver is re-started using the new HTML.

## Contributing
